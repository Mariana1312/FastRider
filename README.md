This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### To run the app use: node server.js + npm start

FastRider is an app for the The Jungle™ amusement park.
The app allows which visitor to order his favorite facility ride in the park with his own pin code.

In the main page the visitor can see all the rides in the park, the amount of tickets left for each ride and the time of the ride.

The main page on desktop mode:

 and on nobile mode:

The user enters his pin code and choosing a ride:

On the mobile mode the Submit button appears after scrolling down through the rides:

After pressing the Submit button the user will get a certificate for his ride with a unique access code:

On desktop mode:

      ![desktop3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17874439/93071081-50cfc400-f688-11ea-9c16-67a2385ab831.jpg)
      
On mobile mode:

      ![mobile3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17874439/93071128-65ac5780-f688-11ea-8ada-a248c5b98f4e.jpg)
      
Now the visitor can enjoy his ride in the park:)



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
